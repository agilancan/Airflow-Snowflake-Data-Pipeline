# Airflow + Snowflake Data Pipeline

This repository is a production-ready data engineering workflow integrating **Apache Airflow** for orchestration and **Snowflake** for cloud data warehousing.

## **Overview**
This project showcases how to:
- Automate data ingestion from cloud storage (AWS S3), transformation, and loading processes.
- Orchestrate complex, dependency-driven workflows with Airflow.
- Store and query large datasets efficiently using Snowflake.
- Handle integration challenges like data format compatibility, failure recovery, and cost control.

## **Problem Addressed**
Data teams often struggle with:
- **Scalability:** Managing ever-growing data volumes.
- **Reliability:** Ensuring workflows run successfully despite failures.
- **Automation:** Reducing manual intervention in ETL processes.
- **Integration:** Connecting orchestration tools to cloud data warehouses.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Avoiding unexpected cloud expenses.

This pipeline addresses these issues by combining Airflow's orchestration capabilities with Snowflake's high-performance cloud data platform.

## **Architecture**
1. **Data Ingestion:** Airflow DAG retrieves raw data from an **AWS S3 bucket**.
2. **Transformation:** Airflow tasks clean and preprocess data using Python/SQL.
3. **Loading:** Processed data is loaded into Snowflake tables.
4. **Monitoring:** Airflowâ€™s UI tracks job statuses; error alerts notify failures.
